# **App Name**: AgriAssist

## Core Features:

- Multilingual Support: Implement a multilingual UI supporting English, Hindi, Marathi, and Telugu. This includes translating all text, labels, and instructions within the app based on the user's selected language.
- Crop Type Selection: Enable users to select either 'fruit' or 'vegetable' crops from a dropdown menu. The subsequent crop selection page will dynamically display only the relevant crops (fruits or vegetables) based on this initial selection.
- Image-Based Disease Detection: Integrate an image analysis tool that uses the uploaded image of the infected plant leaf, soil type selected by the user, and weather data to identify potential diseases or infections. This tool should provide a confidence score for each diagnosis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#32CD32) to evoke a sense of nature and freshness.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) for a clean and modern background.
- Accent: A muted gold (#B8860B) for highlights and calls to action, providing a touch of sophistication.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout to ensure information is well-organized and easy to find. Prioritize readability with ample whitespace.
- Employ clear and intuitive icons to represent different crops, soil types, and menu options. Icons should be consistent in style and easily recognizable.
